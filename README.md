# Bill-Bot
Automates the management of household bills for me and my three roommates including gas, internet, and utilities. This script would save new bills pulled from the provider's page though puppeteer into a Google firebase database. A monthly cron was implemented to send any pending bills as venmo requests to my roommates. This project was used in 2019-2020 and is currently obsolete since the websites have most likely changed and I have also moved since then.
